  To compile and run, I copied and pasted the commands using '<Ctrl C> <Ctrl V>' 'javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java' pasted the command and wrote 'l <Tab> t <Tab>' for auto completion. '<Enter>' for compiling. Then did the same steps for running usin the command 'java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests'

  Step 7 : 
  
  To edit the file, I used the command 'vi' then wrote 'l <tab> . <tab>' for auto completion. Inside the file, I pressed 'i' to enter the insert mode. I modified the mistake which was that the chosen index is wrong, so I corrected it to index2. '<esc>' to exit the insert mode, ':wq' to exit the file.

  Step 8 :
  
  I compiled and run the tester file again. '<up><up><up><up><enter>' By pressing up 4 times through the history I reached the compile command that I did in step 6. 'javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java ListExamplesTests.java' to run, I pressed '<up><up><up><up><enter>' again to reach the run command 'java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests' and by pressing enter I runned the file.
